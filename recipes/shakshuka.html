        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Shakshuka is a vibrant and hearty dish of poached eggs nestled in a rich, spiced tomato and pepper sauce. We add a british pantry staple in this Middle Eastern favorite, to make this the perfect accompaniment to some sasages for breakfast, or steak for a dinner to impress. Often served with crusty bread, it's perfect for breakfast, brunch, or even dinner, offering a delicious blend of savory and slightly tangy notes.</p>
