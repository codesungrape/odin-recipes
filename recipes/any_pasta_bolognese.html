            <h2>Steps</h2>
            <li>Place a heavy-bottomed pot over medium heat. Add oil to the pan. When the oil foams, add the onion, carrots and peppers and 1/4 teaspoon salt. Sautée until opnions are translucent and other vegetables ahve softened.</li>
            <li>Add the celery, aubergine and carrot and sautée for two minutes, cover two mins and sautee for two minutes again, until they have softened some more.</li>
            <li>Next, add the garlic and sautée until fragrant, about 1 minute</li>
            <li>Add the ground beef and pepper. Brown the beef, breaking it up with a wooden spoon as it cooks.</li>
            <li>Once the beef has browned, add the remaining 1/4 teaspoon salt and chillies and crushed tomatoes and mix well, about two minutes.</li>
            <li>Mixe until incorporated, and lower the heat as soon as the tomatoes come up to a boil.</li>
            <li>Cook, covered, for 15-20 mins. Stir occasionally. If the sauce dries out, stir in a 1/4 cup of water, adding a little bit more if needed. Once it is finished, taste for salt and pepper.</li>
